# About

This library provides a set of helper classes for managing colors associated with different seasons. It includes functionality to retrieve the current season's color based on the system date.

## Singleton Pattern
The library implements the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the `SeasonColorManager` class is created. This is achieved through a private constructor and a static property that provides access to the instance.
